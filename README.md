Theses are all different, but there are a number of problems I've run into with my particular thesis, and this repo is somewhere between a template and a notebook that will hopefully help you get through those struggles more quickly if you plan to use R Markdown, **bookdown** (https://bookdown.org/), and LaTeX to compile your thesis. In particular, "02-demo.Rmd" documents most of the "solutions" that worked for me.

If you find any bad advice, please pull request! It's a work in progress, mostly updated as procrastination on my thesis (or to work through formatting struggles).
